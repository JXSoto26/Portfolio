      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello my name is Jeremy Soto Flores, I am currently an intern in OneGig,
        a startup company that 4 months ago give me the opportunity to get into
        this field of web app development to apply my knowledge in HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript and challenged me to jump straight to React. It has been a
        great journey in which I have learned a lot and enjoyed every step of
        the way because I transitioned from working in customer service in Samâ€™s
        Club to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer. Even though I
        am still doing my internship, I feel like it's time to take my next
        step. I am looking for an opportunity to continue growing in this field.
        I love learning new things, receiving feedback and applying it to
        improve every day. My long-term goal is to become a full stack senior
        developer. If you are looking for a person who gives his best every day
        and is hungry to grow and learn, I am the one.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am a Software Developer dedicated to improving skills through hands-on
        learning and development work. Experience in mobile and desktop
        development environments. Adept at using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and
        other programming languages to produce clean code. Well-organized and
        collaborative team player with strong communication and analytical
        abilities.
